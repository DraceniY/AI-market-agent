Inventory levels fell 23% year-on-year as reported in November 2023.\n\n3. **Popularity**: The Samba reached peak popularity in 2023, with a slight decline noted in early 2024. However, it remains one of Adidas's most successful products and has been instrumental in the brand's recent turnaround strategy following the end of the Yeezy partnership.\n\n4. **Market Position**: The Samba has become a lifestyle staple beyond its original soccer training purpose, helping to boost Adidas sales even as the company faced challenges in other areas.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any specific aspect of this data in more detail?"
