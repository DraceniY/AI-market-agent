The shoes have achieved iconic status as a lifestyle staple that transcends their original soccer-inspired purpose.\n\nHowever, there are consistent complaints about the break-in period, with some customers experiencing heel discomfort initially. The narrow fit is also mentioned as a potential issue for some wearers, and there are concerns about how easily the shoes can scuff.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, most reviewers indicate that these issues aren't dealbreakers, and they're able to get substantial use out of the shoes once broken in. The timeless design and versatility with different outfits appear to be the strongest drivers of customer satisfaction."
